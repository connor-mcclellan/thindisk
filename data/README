disk.out1.18000.athdf -- Athena++ simulation snapshot of a 6.62 solar mass
		      	 BH with an initial condition torus set far away
			 from the BH (80 gravitational radii or something)
			 and they let the sim run and form the accretion
			 disk near the center. You're looking edge-on in
			 this snapshot.

			 Quantities
			      - rho: Density
			      - press: Pressure (I think it's gas pressure?)
			      - Er: Radiation energy density
			      - Fr1, Fr2, Fr3
			      - Pr11, Pr22, Pr33, Pr12, 13, 23, 31, 32
			      	These are the radiation pressure tensor matrix
				elements (11, 22, 33 are the diagonal)
			      - Er0: Not really sure
			      - Fr01, Fr02, Fr03: radiation flux tensor 
			      	components. I know one is rphi, not sure what
				the others are.
			      - Sigma_a, Sigma_s: I'm not sure, but if I had
			      	to guess it's the absorption and scattering
				cross-sections but don't quote me

diskmc.out1.00001.athdf -- I ran Shane's Monte Carlo code on the 
			   disk.out1.18000.athdf snapshot, but we zoomed in
			   and only look at the inner ~26 gravitational radii
			   which is where the accretion disk itself is.
			   
			   Quantities
			       - tgas: Gas temperature
			       - rho: Density
			       - Ermc: Radiation energy density
			       - Frmc1: Radiation Flux **I forget which 
			       	 	components of the radiation flux tensor
					these are. I know One of them is r-phi,
					and the others are something. I can
					find out if you need them.
			       - Frmc2: Radiation Flux ^
			       - Frmc3: Radiation Flux ^
			       - Prmc11, Prmc22, Prmc33, 12, 13, 23 ,21, 31, 32
			       	 These are the radiation pressure tensor matrix
				 elements (11, 22, 33 are the diagonal)
			       - Eavemc: Essentially <h*nu>
			       - kapjmc: J-mean intensity opacity ("kappa_J")
			       

Using plot_spherical.py to plot things like the density and temperature
      ***Note: Use python2 when plotting. If you use Python3 you'll get a 
      	 "coordinates not recognized" error because of the way it reads 
	 string characters

For all the input variables and kwargs, do python2 plot_spherical.py -h
