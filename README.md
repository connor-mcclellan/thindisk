# Thin Disk Accretion Model
<sub>Asia Hubbard, Trent Brooks

### Introduction

This project explores the equations of the thin disk accretion model, considered with both Newtonian gravity and General Relativity (Novikov & Thorne, 1973). This README provides an overview of the project and its current status. Notes on key topics and discoveries are added as the project progresses. Tutorials for running Python and Jupyter Notebooks are included in the [thindisk/tutorials](tutorials) directory.
  
### Key Concepts
  
> #### Accretion
> Gravitational forces from massive objects pull things inwards. Accretion is what happens when matter actually falls on to the central object. In a lot of cases, due to conservation of angular momentum and friction forces, the matter will organize itself into a disk as it falls inwards, called an **accretion disk**[<sup>(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk).

  
### Current Status
  
Student researchers are developing skills in Python that will be used to visualize the radial structure of the thin accretion disk.
