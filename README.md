# Thin Disk Accretion Model
<sub>Asia Hubbard, Trent Brooks

<sup>Advised by B. Connor McClellan
  
### Introduction

This project explores the equations of the thin disk accretion model, considered with both Newtonian gravity and General Relativity (Novikov & Thorne, 1973). This README provides an overview of the project and its current status. Notes on key topics and discoveries are added as the project progresses. 
  
### Current Status
  
Student researchers are developing skills in Python that will be used to visualize the radial structure of the thin accretion disk. Tutorials in running Python and Jupyter Notebooks are included in the ````
