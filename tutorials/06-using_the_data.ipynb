    "In this tutorial, we'll cover how to download and run the scripts you need to process our sample Athena++ data. From this we will create 1-D radial profiles of the density, gas temperature, and energy density of the midplane of the disk. With a little more work, we can also get the flux in the photosphere of the disk, but that will be a later tutorial."

    " - `plot_spherical.py` : The name of the python script we want to run.\n",
    " - `-am` : These are known as **optional command-line arguments**. They don't have to be included for the program to run successfully, but `plot_spherical.py` is written in a way that it can accomplish one of several tasks depending on which options you specify. `-am` is shorthand for `-a -m`, which activates the flags `--average` and `--midplane`.\n",
    " - `diskmc.out1.00001.athdf` : The name of the data file we want to process. This is a **positional command-line argument**, and the script can't run without it.\n",
    " - `rho` : This is the name of the variable we want to plot on the y-axis, and is also a positional command-line argument. \"rho\" means density. The variables to choose from are \"tgas\", \"rho\", \"Ermc\", \"Frmc1\", \"Frmc2\", \"Frmc3\", \"Prmc11\", \"Prmc22\", \"Prmc33\", \"Prmc12\", \"Prmc13\", \"Prmc23\", \"Prmc21\", \"Prmc31\", \"Prmc32\", \"Cooling\", \"Eavemc\", and \"kapjmc\".\n",
