    "Good question. After installing Anaconda on your computer, a lot of things will just *work*. So, you can use the command prompt (\"powershell\") to navigate around and create, view, delete, and run code files, and Anaconda will step in when it needs to to launch your text editor or run a script with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick-launch guide:**\n",
    " * Open \"Windows Powershell\" by clicking in the search bar and typing \"powershell\". Press enter to open a terminal.\n",
    " * Navigate around with the following commands:\n",
    " \n",
    " `ls`: Shows the contents of the current folder, or \"directory\". It will show the date and time last modified, the file type, and the name.\n",
    " \n",
    " `cd`: Short for \"change directory\". You can use this to change what folder you're in by typing \"`cd name_of_folder`\"\n",
    " \n",
    " `mkdir`: Make Directory. Create a new folder with \"`mkdir name_of_new_folder`\"\n",
    " \n",
    " `rm`: Remove. Be VERY careful with this. In the command line, if you tell your computer to delete something, it'll do it without question. If you misspell a file or accidentally tell it to delete an entire folder, it'll do it without asking for confirmation. Usage: \"`rm file_to_be_deleted`\"\n",
    " \n",
    " `jupyter notebook`: This will start up your web browser with a Jupyter Notebook interface. This comes installed with Anaconda, and it basically uses your browser as a user-friendly interface for coding. You can create files, write code, run code, *everything*---and the files remain stored locally on your computer."
